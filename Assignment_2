'=================================================

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Ans:    X     Y     Not X   X And Y   X Or Y
      false	false	  true	   false	   false
      false	true	  true	   false	   true
      true	false	  false	   false	   true
      true	true	  false	   true	     true

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)

Ans: (5 > 4) and (3 == 5) ----- False
      not (5 > 4) ----- False
      (5 > 4) or (3 == 5) ----- True
      not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) ---- False
      (True and True) and (True == False) ---- False
      (not False) or (not True) ----- True

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Ans:
spam = int(input("Enter the value - "))
if spam == 1:
    print('Hello!')
elif spam == 2:
    print('Howdy!')
else:
    print('Greetings!')

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?

'=================================================

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans: Break statement resumes the control of the program to the end of loop and made executional flow outside that loop. 
     Continue statement resumes the control of the program to the next iteration of that loop enclosing 'continue' and made executional flow inside the loop again.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans: Nothing Difference, All will return the same result (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
'=================================================

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Ans:
#Using For Loop
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)  

#Using While Loop
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i +=1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
